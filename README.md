# garbageman

A brand new shiny package manager. Innovative, slick and lightweight.

Installs packages from git to your piece of shit project. 

## Where are the packages stored?
There is no database. Packages URLs are store in this repository in the [issues](https://github.com/faso/garbageman/issues). Serverless, bitch.

## How do I add my own package?
Open a new [issue](https://github.com/faso/garbageman/issues/new). That's it. Garbageman will just grab you shitty package from there automatically.

## Where are my installed packages?
In the "garbage" directory

## Usage?
Give the exe file a package name

## How does it handle dependencies?
It doesn't

## Package search?
Nope

## Node.js integration?
I think you're not paying attention here

## The exe file just outputs "fuck you" sometimes!
Fuck you then
